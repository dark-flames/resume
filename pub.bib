abstract = {Gradual typing supports imprecise types in the type system, allowing incremental migration from untyped code to typed in the same language. Through the gradual typing approach, our ongoing work proposes a new theory based on the Martin-L\"{o}f type theory called Partial Gradual Dependent Type Theory. PGTT supports a gradual step from non-dependently typed code to dependently typed, enhancing the functionality of code reasoning while preserving the usability of widely used non-dependent type systems. PGTT restricts entirely unknown types and only permits dynamic terms on the type indices, making it naturally maintain better properties than existing gradual dependent type theories. It allows us to simplify runtime type checks into type parameter checks and elaborate the surface language into a static, dependently typed language, thereby reducing the performance overhead associated with gradual typing.},
