      - Implementation of dependently typed programming languages, focusing on features such as pattern matching.
      - Semantic models of type theories, especially categorical semantics, leverage categorical perspectives to grasp the essence of new language features quickly.
      - Semantics-based approaches for programming languages, such as normalization-by-evaluation and logical relations.
      - Dependent version of practical type systems, such as gradual typing and effect systems.
